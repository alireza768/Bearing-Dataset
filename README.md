# Conrod-Bearing Dataset

- collected from the top view of a 4-cylinder EF7 engine block
- engine block contains four moving bearings
- contains 2000 images in 16 classes
- image resolution has been set to 3280Ã—2460
- Invalve all wrong assembly of conrod-bearing
- Using 8-megapixel Raspberry Pi camera to collect the images
- annotate the data in the YOLO format
